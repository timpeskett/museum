I managed to recover a lot of the programs that I wrote during my high school days. Putting the more interesting of these into one repo shows a nice progression of my programming ability, I suppose. 


When these programs were written I had no formal training in programming. It's interesting to note that the biggest thing that has changed over time is simply naming conventions and program organisation. Most of the code is fairly readable and well indented. Unfortunately I didn't see much value in comments at the time


All of this code was written for Windows XP. Most of it still runs on newer versions of Windows I believe (all screengrabs were taken on Windows 7).

The following programs are ordered by last modification date of the final executable.


#DeskDraw
##A program to draw on the desktop
##October, 2009

This program was (most likely) inspired by the new smartboards that our school installed. It also seems like it could be an interesting idea but I don't really remember ever finding this useful. I suppose it could be used where there is a projector without a touch screen but I should think there are probably better open source alternatives now.

Holding down the middle mouse button is used to draw.

There's not really a great deal to say about the functionality, it does what it says. I never got around to implementing erasing so the lines only go away when the window they are 'above' is updated. The lines also don't stay there when windows are moved around. I don't think it ever got finished because I realised I would never use it.
