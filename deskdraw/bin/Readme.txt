Desktop Draw is an application which allows the user to draw on the desktop in either blue or red.


How to use:
Once the application is open, select the colour you would like to use in the 'ToolBox' and then hold down the middle mouse button to draw.

Known Bugs/Limitations:
No good eraser. Toolbox can be used to erase but there is no actual eraser option. There are no easy ways to implement this feature and it would require a lot of work. Maybe drawing a small window over where ever the user clicks, but that'd be the lowest common denominator.
When new pen is selected and used, line is drawn from ending point of last line to where user middle clicks. I have no idea why this bug even exists but it probably wouldn't be too hard to fix if I could be bothered doing it. Can be avoided by left-clicking on the window you are drawing on before you start drawing.
Drawing is erased by anything on the desktop that is redrawn. This is a pain in the arse but is bearable.
